## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **Svelte**. It's a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The goal is to be the first to align three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game keeps track of rounds, announces the winner, and allows for resetting the game as well as clearing the round history and player names.

Enjoy playing and testing your skills! ðŸŽ®


# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
